1. Introduction


Virtual Treeview is a Delphi treeview control built from ground up. Many years of 
development made it one of the most flexible and advanced tree controls available today. 
Virtual Treeview starts off with the claim to improve many aspects of existing solutions 
and introduces some new technologies and principles which were not available before.

This is a source-only release of TurboPack VirtualTree. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi and CBuilder and supports Win32 and Win64.
