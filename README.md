# Concepts

Concepts is a modular Delphi application which illustrates some language features, design patterns and some interresting frameworks and components which include:

* [Spring4D](http://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d)
* [DSharp](http://bitbucket.org/sglienke/dsharp)
* [Virtual treeview](http://github.com/Virtual-TreeView/Virtual-TreeView)
* [TChromeTabs](http://github.com/norgepaul/TChromeTabs) component
* [SQLBuilder4Delphi](http://github.com/) 

All the libraries that the project depends on are included (except commercial ones of course) avoid installation hassles for anyone who tries to compile the project. 
In the [Concepts.inc](http://github.com/beNative/Concepts/blob/master/Concepts.inc) file you can specify which dependencies you want to have included in your build.

Check the releases to download a precompiled executable of the project.
